Thesis 📜 # Provable security of real world protocols Provable security is a very useful cryptographic tool that helps in the evaluation of the security of a protocol. In order to construct a proof, one must first define the security properties that are to be achieved, i.e., the security model, as well as what kind of adversary we are facing. In this thesis, we introduce (or adapt) models in which we give security proofs for three kinds of protocols with real-life applications: a secure messaging protocol, a sanitizable signature, and a reverse firewall.
