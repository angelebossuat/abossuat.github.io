I am currently a cryptographer at [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/). 
I work on any part of our clients' product's life, giving advice on protocol choices during the design, auditing after it's built, helping with choosing a new algorithm for updates (e.g. when transitioning to post-quantum), etc.

I also enjoy working on the blog as an editor/reviewer, sometimes writer.
When I get the chance, I like to present my work either internally or more publicly.

Before Qb, I did a Ph.D. at the IRISA lab in Rennes, in what was then known as the [EMSEC](https://www.irisa.fr/equipes/emsec) team, under supervision of [Pierre-Alain Fouque](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/) and [Cristina Onete](https://www.onete.net/).
I worked on the security of so-called *Real-World Protocols*, such as TLS and Signal.
Researching and writing on Signal made me very fond of secure messaging in general, which I still love today. :hearts:
