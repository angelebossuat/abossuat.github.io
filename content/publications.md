[Triple Threat: Signal's Ratchet Goes Post-Quantum](https://blog.quarkslab.com/triple-threat-signals-ratchet-goes-post-quantum.html)
: *A mid-level overview of Signal's SPQR protocol, which brings post-quantum cryptography to the key derivation for messages.*

[Non-Compliant, So What?](https://blog.quarkslab.com/non-compliant-crypto.html)
: *A discussion on crypto findings in audits, specifically on (non-)compliance.*

[Secure Messaging Apps And Group Protocols part 1](https://blog.quarkslab.com/secure-messaging-apps-and-group-protocols-part-1.html) [and 2](https://blog.quarkslab.com/secure-messaging-apps-and-group-protocols-part-2.html)
: *A step-by-step explaination of how secure messaging is built. The second part focuses on group protocols, especially MLS.*

## Thesis :scroll:

[Provable security of real world protocols](https://theses.fr/2020REN1S101)
: Provable security is a very useful cryptographic tool that helps in the evaluation of the security of a protocol. In order to construct a proof, one must first define the security properties that are to be achieved, i.e., the security model, as well as what kind of adversary we are facing. In this thesis, we introduce (or adapt) models in which we give security proofs for three kinds of protocols with real-life applications: a secure messaging protocol, a sanitizable signature, and a reverse firewall.
