I am currently in the following conferences' PC:
- [SSTIC](https://www.sstic.org)
- [GreHack](https://grehack.fr/)

I try to actively participate in initiatives to bring more women into the field -- during my masters' and Ph.D., I worked with [Filles et Maths](https://filles-et-maths.fr/), and [L Codent L Créent](http://lclc-rennes.irisa.fr/). :fist:

When I have (had) the time, I like playing around in [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/user/abmon/), [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org/angieornot), and I attended the [BreizhCTF](https://www.breizhctf.com/) a few times.\
I also try to follow [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
